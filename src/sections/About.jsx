              <p>
                My journey into web development started with my love for art,
                colour, and creative expression. I’ve always been drawn to
                beauty and meaning in visual form, and when I discovered
                technology, web development became the perfect fusion of both
                worlds. It felt natural, like I had found the space where logic
                and creativity could truly meet.
              </p>
              <p>
                With React, Next.js, and TypeScript, I create everything from
                sleek landing pages to complex digital products. I care deeply
                about clean architecture, refined design, and experiences
                polished down to the smallest detail. Yes, I’m a bit of a
                perfectionist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of coding, you’ll find me exploring new tech, reading
                books especially philosophy, gaming, trying new recipes, writing
                my thoughts, and grounding everything in faith. I believe growth
                is a lifelong journey in skill, in character, and in purpose.
